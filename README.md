# Finovia Protocol Notes (Public Version)

This repository contains a high-level, non-sensitive overview of the protocol concepts behind Finovia — a settlement-first financial operating kernel designed for real-time value flow, programmatic accounting, and modular economic primitives.

These notes outline the conceptual architecture only.  
No proprietary code, schemas, or internal logic are included.

## 📚 Contents

### primitives/
Foundational economic and protocol primitives:
- minting.md — how value is created, issued, and constrained
- incentives.md — how actors are motivated and aligned
- flows.md — how value, state, and obligations move through the system
- settlement.md — how finality, ordering, and reconciliation occur

### diagrams/
- protocol_overview.png — high-level conceptual diagram of the protocol layers

## 🧩 What Finovia Represents

Finovia is designed as:
- **Layer 0:** Settlement engine  
- **Layer 1:** Financial operating kernel  
- **Layer 2:** Programmatic accounting + value flows  
- **Layer 3:** Application surfaces (POSOVIA, Medovia, etc.)

This repo captures the *ideas*, not the implementation.
