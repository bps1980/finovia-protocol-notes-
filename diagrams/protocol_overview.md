A high-level diagram showing:

Layer 0 — Settlement Engine  
Layer 1 — Financial Operating Kernel  
Layer 2 — Programmatic Accounting & Value Flows  
Layer 3 — Application Surfaces (POSOVIA, Medovia, etc.)

Arrows show:
- minting
- incentives
- flows
- settlement

The diagram visually represents how value moves from applications → kernel → settlement → back to applications.
