# Settlement Primitive

Settlement is the foundation of Finovia.  
It ensures that every action, obligation, and value movement reaches finality.

## 🧱 Settlement Types

### 1. **Immediate Settlement**
Finality occurs instantly.

### 2. **Deferred Settlement**
Finality occurs after conditions are met.

### 3. **Net Settlement**
Multiple flows are collapsed into a single final movement.

### 4. **Programmatic Settlement**
Finality triggered by rules or program state.

1. Flow generated  
2. Obligations evaluated  
3. Netting or clearing  
4. Finality achieved  
5. Ledger locked  
6. Program state updated  

Settlement is the “truth layer” of Finovia.
